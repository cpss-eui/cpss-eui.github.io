DESCRIPTION:Title: Which counterspeech strategy mitigates intergroup hostility and its amplification on social media? Evidence from a field experiment on the role of empathy (with Gloria Gennaro, UCL; Laurenz Derksen, ETH; Aya Abdelrahman, ETH; Emma Broggini, ETH; Mariya Alexandra Green, ETH; Victoria Andrea Haerter, ETH; Elia Heer, ETH; Isabel Heidler, ETH; Fiona Kauer, ETH; Han-Nuri Kim, ETH; Benjamin Landry, ETH; Alessio Levis, ETH; Jiazhen Li, UZH; Şevval Şimşir, ETH; Iva Srbinovska, ETH; Robin Anna Vital, ETH; Karsten Donnay, UZH; and Fabrizio Gilardi, UZH)nAbstract:Online intergroup hostility is a pervasive and troubling issue, yet experimental evidence on how to curb it remains scarce. This study focuses on counterspeech as a means for users to reduce hate speech. Informed by theories from social psychology about the role of empathy in overcoming prejudice, we randomize four counterspeec strategies across the senders of 2,102 xenophobic Twitter messages. Compared to the control group, the three empathy-based strategies increase the sender’s propensity to delete the xenophobic message, reduce the share of new xenophobic messages over the following four weeks, and decrease other users’ amplification of the xenophobic message. Among these strategies, analogical perspective-taking, encouraging the sender to compare their own experiences of being attacked online with their discriminatory behavior towards the outgroup, is particularly effective. In contrast, disapproval messages have weaker effects. These findings provide theoretical and actionable insights for how to reduce intergroup hostility and its online amplification.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Downward Class Mobility and Far-Right Party Support (with Alan M. Jacobs, UBC)nAbstract:The relative effects of economic and social change on support for far-right parties persistently occupies the attention of scholars and the public. We argue that many explanations, by examining short-run economic change or levels of social and cultural characteristics, miss a core determinant of the rise of the far right: long-run material deterioration, with its concomitant implications for social status. Employing intergenerational occupational mobility, a measure uniquely able to capture both components, we provide the first broad evidence of this pattern across 10 countries and 2 decades. We then distinguish (a) between level and change effects with the aid of diagonal reference models and (b) between income and status effects through the use of historical occupational wage data. Downward (but not upward) occupational mobility predicts far-right voting across ten developed democracies and intergenerational differences in real income play a role independent of occupational status.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Executive Appointments under Legislative Oversight (with Mikael Holmgren, Örebro University)nAbstract:A large literature argues that the executive’s appointment powers may bestow them with a significant policy advantage against the legislature. In practice, however, the legislature may also deploy a variety of instruments to strike back at the executive. In this paper, we field five decades’ worth of data from the Swedish government to investigate whether the executive might adapt their appointment strategies to legislative pressures. We take advantage of a vast system of ad-hoc commissions that the Swedish ministers have developed over time to track their sensitivity to the parliament’s partisan composition. We find that, while the ministers generally oversample appointees from their own parties, the overall distribution of political appointees also tends to shift along with the parliament’s balance of power. In line with recent theories of interbranch relations, our results highlight both the executive’s penchant for strategic appointments and the legislature’s constraining reach.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Chasing Opportunities in the Knowledge Economy: Moving Places, Moving Politics? (with Valentina Consiglio, University of Konstanz)nAbstract:The rise of the knowledge economy has profoundly transformed the political landscape. Thriving urban knowledge hubs have become almost synonymous with cosmopolitan environments whereas lagging-behind areas are characterized by stronger anti-establishment sentiments. We advance the literature with a more dynamic perspective by studying individual relocations to examine the political consequences of the strong pull into destinations that are typically more progressive than most places of origin. We propose an innovative measure of local opportunity at the NUTS-3 level in Germany and merge this “opportunity map” with individual-level panel data to assess how relocations into knowledge hubs affect political behavior. In line with a mechanism of assimilation, we find strong and consistent evidence that moving to opportunity fosters political integration and shifts political preferences to the left. Our findings suggest that the ongoing movement of populations from rural regions to prosperous cities may come with a self-reinforcing political dynamic that creates a strong and lasting progressive coalition in the mid- and long-term.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The C-SPAN Effect: Televised Debates, Emotional Appeals, and Political AccountabilitynAbstract:We study the effect of televised broadcasts of floor debates on the rhetoric and behavior of U.S. Congress Members. First, we show in a differences-in-differences analysis that the introduction of C-SPAN broadcasts in 1979 increased the use of emotional appeals in the House relative to the Senate, where televised floor debates were not introduced until later. Second, we use exogenous variation in C-SPAN channel positioning as an instrument for C-SPAN viewership by Congressional district and show that House Members from districts with exogenously higher C-SPAN viewership are more emotive in floor debates. Looking to electoral pressures as a mechanism, we find the emotionality effect of C-SPAN is strongest in competitive districts. C-SPAN exposure increases the vote share for incumbent Congress Members and citizens' approval of their job in Congress, and more so among Members who speak more emotionally. Contra accountability models of transparency, C-SPAN has no effect on measures of legislative effort on behalf of constituents, and if anything it reduces a politician's constituency orientation. We find that local news coverage -- that is, mediated rather than direct transparency -- has the opposite effect of C-SPAN, increasing legislative effort but with no effect on emotional rhetoric. These results highlight the importance of audience and mediation in the political impacts of higher transparency.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Limits of Decentralized Administrative Data Collection: Evidence from Colombia (with Tara Slough, New York University)nAbstract:States collect vast amounts of data for use in policymaking and public administration. To do so, central governments frequently solicit data from decentralized bureaucrats. Because central governments use these data in policymaking, decentralized bureaucrats may face incentives to selectively report or misreport, limiting the quality of administrative data. We study the production of a transparency index by measuring the reporting behavior of bureaucrats in the near universe of Colombian public sector entities. Using an original audit, we show that failure to report and misreporting vary systematically in actual transparency practices, revealing limits to the use of these data. Further, in partnership with a Colombian government watchdog agency, we implement a large-scale experiment that varies the salience of central government oversight. Increased salience changed the data bureaucrats reported to the central government. Similar dynamics across policy areas and regime types are apt to limit the quality of state information in multiple contexts.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Supportive Political Participation: The Effects of Serving as a Poll WorkernAbstract:Participatory theories of democracy posit that participating in the political process transforms individuals into better democratic citizens. But empirical research on the individual-level effects of participation focuses overwhelmingly on voting, with mixed results and debate about the mechanisms. This study focuses on a different form of political participation and leverages a natural experiment in Peru to address the challenge posed by certain types of individuals self-selecting into political participation. Prior to every election, Peruvian officials randomly select citizens to serve as poll monitors on Election Day. Following the January 2020 congressional elections, I conducted a two-wave panel survey of these randomly selected poll monitors and also randomly selected alternates. I find that participation as a poll worker increases an individual’s senses of empowerment and efficacy, but does not provoke political interest or knowledge. I also find that participation boosts support for and trust in democratic institutions, especially elections, and that it fosters future civic participation. I find some evidence that these effects endure, at least for several months, although my follow-up estimates are less precise. Consistent with participatory theories of democracy, participation of this kind does shape citizens.

DESCRIPTION:Title: In or Out? Xenophobic Violence and Immigrant Integration. Evidence from 19th century France (with Stephane Wolton, LSE)nAbstract:How do immigrants respond to xenophobic violence? We study how Italian immigrants responded to a wave of anti-Italian violence triggered by the assassination of the French president by an Italian anarchist in June 1894. Using French nominative census records from 1886, 1891 and 1896 and official naturalization decrees published between 1887 to 1898, we study the decision of Italian immigrants to either leave their host communities or apply for naturalization using a difference-in-differences design, comparing the change in exit and naturalization application rate of Italians before and after the assassination to that of other foreigners in the same period. We document how xenophobic violence triggered an increase in both exits and naturalization applications, with greater violence or threat thereof associated with more exits and naturalization applications. We also find that well-integrated Italians, as proxied by family status, are more likely to naturalize and less integrated ones are more likely to exit. We present a stylized model of immigrants’ choices to make sense of these findings
