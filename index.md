**Supportive Political Participation: The Effects of Serving as a Poll
Worker**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Participatory theories of democracy posit that participating in the
political process transforms individuals into better democratic
citizens. But empirical research on the individual-level effects of
participation focuses overwhelmingly on voting, with mixed results and
debate about the mechanisms. This study focuses on a different form of
political participation and leverages a natural experiment in Peru to
address the challenge posed by certain types of individuals
self-selecting into political participation. Prior to every election,
Peruvian officials randomly select citizens to serve as poll monitors on
Election Day. Following the January 2020 congressional elections, I
conducted a two-wave panel survey of these randomly selected poll
monitors and also randomly selected alternates. I find that
participation as a poll worker increases an individual’s senses of
empowerment and efficacy, but does not provoke political interest or
knowledge. I also find that participation boosts support for and trust
in democratic institutions, especially elections, and that it fosters
future civic participation. I find some evidence that these effects
endure, at least for several months, although my follow-up estimates are
less precise. Consistent with participatory theories of democracy,
participation of this kind does shape citizens.

**In or Out? Xenophobic Violence and Immigrant Integration. Evidence
from 19th century France (with Stephane Wolton, LSE)**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
How do immigrants respond to xenophobic violence? We study how Italian
immigrants responded to a wave of anti-Italian violence triggered by the
assassination of the French president by an Italian anarchist in June
1894. Using French nominative census records from 1886, 1891 and 1896
and official naturalization decrees published between 1887 to 1898, we
study the decision of Italian immigrants to either leave their host
communities or apply for naturalization using a
difference-in-differences design, comparing the change in exit and
naturalization application rate of Italians before and after the
assassination to that of other foreigners in the same period. We
document how xenophobic violence triggered an increase in both exits and
naturalization applications, with greater violence or threat thereof
associated with more exits and naturalization applications. We also find
that well-integrated Italians, as proxied by family status, are more
likely to naturalize and less integrated ones are more likely to exit.
We present a stylized model of immigrants’ choices to make sense of
these findings
