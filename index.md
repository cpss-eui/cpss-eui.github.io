**The ethics of asking about violence: Early evidence from a multisite
experiment**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Political violence – including civil war, organized crime, and violent
extremism – is a major driver of human suffering around the world.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more
than 100 million people, or one in every 78 people on earth, were
displaced because of conflict or violence in 2022. Over the past two
decades, there has been a proliferation of research involving human
participants on the topic of violence in the social and behavioral
sciences. However, we have surprisingly little evidence about how
participating in research that asks about violence affects participants
and whether we are effectively adhering to principles around respect for
persons when doing research on this especially sensitive and high-stakes
topic. This talk will present preliminary evidence from a systematic
review and multisite experiment to measure the effects of participating
in research on violence and develop new methods to maximize adherence to
the ethical principles of respect for persons and beneficence.

**Undoing Insulation: Politicization and Revolving Doors in a Closed
Weberian Bureaucracy**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Academic and policy discussions regarding the bureaucracy often advocate
for robust civil service systems, incorporating meritocratic entrance
exams, competitive salaries, and lifelong tenure in order to curb
political influence and promote effective governance. Using a unique and
comprehensive administrative dataset covering the selection and careers
of various elite civil service corps in Spain from 1940 to 2023, we
unveil striking patterns that challenge conventional wisdom about
Weberian bureaucracies. First, our findings reveal that a substantial
portion of elite civil servants depart from the corps to pursue roles in
the private sector or assume high-level political positions. Second, we
identify pronounced partisan patterns in the recruitment of elite civil
servants for top-tier political appointments, with certain corps
consistently aligned with the left while others lean towards the right.
Third, we show that while these elite civil service corps have become
more diverse in terms of gender, they remain largely biased in their
socioeconomic profile. In summary, our study demonstrates that the
formal insulation and meritocratic principles of Weberian bureaucracies
can coexist with enduring socioeconomic biases and the integration of
bureaucratic, political, and corporate career paths.

**A Rich Woman’s World? Wealth and Gendered Paths to Office**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
We introduce and seek to explain a new and surprising fact about members
of the US Congress: since at least the 1980s, Congresswomen have been
substantially wealthier than Congressmen serving in the same party and
decade. We articulate three mechanisms that could explain this gender
wealth gap, and use new data on the backgrounds and families of members
of Congress to evaluate each mechanism. We find no evidence that the
wealth gap arises because districts likely to elect women also elect
wealthier members, or because women had more lucrative pre-Congressional
careers. We do find evidence that the gap can be explained by women
facing steeper challenges that wealth helps them overcome—particularly
related to caregiving—and by Congresswomen’s spouses earning more money
than Congressmen’s spouses. Our analysis sheds light on how obstacles
facing ambitious women can lead to apparently counterintuitive
advantages among the women who manage to succeed.

**Mutual Knowledge of Social Norms and Political Activism**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Social norms are important drivers of human behavior. Problematically,
when individuals hold incorrect beliefs about others’ opinions, a norm
may be sustained even if a majority is against it (pluralistic
ignorance). However, it may not be sufficient to correct such
misperceptions as citizens may continue to believe that others do not
share the updated beliefs. In this case, creating mutual knowledge about
social norms may be necessary to induce behavioral change. We implement
a field experiment in Kyrgyzstan to test this hypothesis. We vary i)
whether women are provided with information on high social support for
female political engagement, and ii) whether women are informed that
this information is also provided to other women (“mutual knowledge”).
We find that providing information about high societal support has no
effect on women’s political engagement. However, women become less
engaged when we also experimentally create mutual knowledge about the
social norm opposing female engagement. Yet, there is no positive effect
on female engagement when providing mutual knowledge about high social
support. Using vignette experiments, we show that the asymmetry arises
because women fear community punishment—in case they are more active
than socially desired—more so than potential community praise when they
become active when more engagement is desired.
