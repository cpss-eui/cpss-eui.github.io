**Supportive Political Participation: The Effects of Serving as a Poll
Worker**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Participatory theories of democracy posit that participating in the
political process transforms individuals into better democratic
citizens. But empirical research on the individual-level effects of
participation focuses overwhelmingly on voting, with mixed results and
debate about the mechanisms. This study focuses on a different form of
political participation and leverages a natural experiment in Peru to
address the challenge posed by certain types of individuals
self-selecting into political participation. Prior to every election,
Peruvian officials randomly select citizens to serve as poll monitors on
Election Day. Following the January 2020 congressional elections, I
conducted a two-wave panel survey of these randomly selected poll
monitors and also randomly selected alternates. I find that
participation as a poll worker increases an individual’s senses of
empowerment and efficacy, but does not provoke political interest or
knowledge. I also find that participation boosts support for and trust
in democratic institutions, especially elections, and that it fosters
future civic participation. I find some evidence that these effects
endure, at least for several months, although my follow-up estimates are
less precise. Consistent with participatory theories of democracy,
participation of this kind does shape citizens.

**Resemblance and Discrimination in Elections (with Stavros Poupakis,
Brunel University London)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Discrimination affects hiring, mating and voting decisions. Whilst
discrimination in elections mainly relates to gender or race, we
introduce a novel source of discrimination: candidate resemblance. When
candidates’ partisanship is not known, voters select those that resemble
most elected co-partisans. Using a machine learning algorithm for face
comparison among white male legislators, we find a stronger resemblance
effect for Republicans compared to Democrats in the US. This happens
because Republicans have a higher within-party facial resemblance than
Democrats, even when accounting for gender and race. We find a similar
pattern in the UK, where Conservative MPs are more similar looking to
each other than Labour. Using a survey experiment, we find that Tory
voters reward resemblance, while there is no similar effect for Labour.
The results are consistent with an interpretation of this behaviour as a
form of statistical discrimination.

**In or Out? Xenophobic Violence and Immigrant Integration. Evidence
from 19th century France (with Stephane Wolton, LSE)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
How do immigrants respond to xenophobic violence? We study how Italian
immigrants responded to a wave of anti-Italian violence triggered by the
assassination of the French president by an Italian anarchist in June
1894. Using French nominative census records from 1886, 1891 and 1896
and official naturalization decrees published between 1887 to 1898, we
study the decision of Italian immigrants to either leave their host
communities or apply for naturalization using a
difference-in-differences design, comparing the change in exit and
naturalization application rate of Italians before and after the
assassination to that of other foreigners in the same period. We
document how xenophobic violence triggered an increase in both exits and
naturalization applications, with greater violence or threat thereof
associated with more exits and naturalization applications. We also find
that well-integrated Italians, as proxied by family status, are more
likely to naturalize and less integrated ones are more likely to exit.
We present a stylized model of immigrants’ choices to make sense of
these findings

**Cultural Roots of Negative Outgroup Attitudes: Theory and Evidence
from the Re-activation of Antisemitic Stereotypes in Germany (with Eylem
Kanol, WZB)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Outgroup prejudice is frequently attributed to contemporaneous factors,
such as economic competition and perceptions of threat. We investigate
the underlying source of stereotypes. We propose that many negative
outgroup attitudes are ultimately rooted in what we refer to as cultural
scripts—interconnected networks of meanings that link particular group
identities to negatively-connoted phenomena. Using original survey data
during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany (n=17,800), we document a rise
in antisemitic attitudes among individuals directly exposed to the
pandemic, but solely among Christian believers. We suggest that this is
because Christians rely on a cultural script linking Judaism with the
spread of diseases. Evidence for the existence of this script is
obtained from an automated text analysis of an original corpus of
antisemitic texts (n=172). By means of a concept association task and a
survey experiment (n=2,000), we demonstrate the differential effect of
the script in the minds of Christians and non-Christians. We rule out
several alternative explanations, particularly right-wing ideology. Our
work demonstrates the deep cultural roots of exclusionary political
attitudes and the mechanisms behind their activation.

**“Evaluating the Effects of Inclusive Historical Narratives on
Democratic Attitudes: Evidence from India and the United States” (with
Nicholas Haas, Aarhus University)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Concerns about the state of democracy have surged in several countries
amongst new evidence that many citizens do not value democratic
principles or accept election results. Many suggest that at the core of
these anti-democratic beliefs is a dismissal of some voters – ethnic
minorities – as lesser members of the nation. In this project, we study
whether historical narratives that highlight ethnic minorities’ positive
contributions to the nation increase perceptions that they are entitled
to speak on the nation’s behalf, and thereby enhance majority members
support for the democratic process. We theorise that inclusive
historical narratives can counteract the notion that minorities are
lesser members of the nation and thus, the anti-democratic belief that
their votes count less or not at all. To test our theory, we conduct
online experiments in the world’s two largest democracies: India and the
United States. In our experiments, we randomly assign participants
either politically neutral or inclusive educational content sourced from
real history textbooks. We then use both behavioural and stated
preference measures to evaluate whether different historical narratives
affect perceptions of minorities’ place in the nation and support for
anti-democratic attitudes, norms, and policies. Our findings indicate
that battles over history education may carry consequences for majority
members’ support for democratic principles and ethnic minorities’
political voice.

**Is Political Ignorance bliss? The Social and Political Effects of
Facebook (with Martial Foucault, CEVIPOF; Kalli Giannelos, CEVIPOF &
Paris-Dauphine; Jonathan Ladd, Georgetown U; Can Zengin, CEVIPOF &
Temple U)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Nearly three billion people actively use Facebook, making it the largest
social media platform in the world. Previous research shows that the
social media platform reduces users’ happiness, while increasing
political knowledge. It also may increase partisan polarization. Working
to build a scientific consensus, we test whether the potential negative
effects of Facebook use can be overcome with the help of minimalist
informational interventions that a parallel line of research has shown
to be effective at inducing people to be more accurate and civil. We
conducted a preregistered well-powered Facebook deactivation experiment
during the 2022 French presidential election. In line with previous
research, we find that Facebook reduces happiness, informs, and
increases partisan polarization but only among college educated
individuals. In contrast, we find little evidence that minimalist
informational interventions in a field setting helped individuals who
deactivated Facebook to seek out news, be more accurate or less
polarized.

**Trade Origins of Proportional Representation (with Irene Menéndez
Gonzalez, IE University)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
While recent research on the origins of Proportional Representation (PR)
in Europe has focused on domestic political explanations, we bring
international trade back to the analysis of electoral system choice.
First, we sharpen earlier arguments and specify the partisan trade
theory of endogenous electoral institutions, which highlights how the
misrepresentation of trade interests in parliament shapes support for
PR. Second, we test the theory using district-level referendum data and
a natural experiment during the first globalization in Switzerland. We
find a robust positive relationship between the vote for free trade and
the subsequent vote for PR. Moreover, within-district change in the
protectionist factor was tightly linked to changes in the PR vote.
Leveraging plausibly exogenous variation in the introduction of PR
across cantons, we also find that PR reduced the underrepresentation of
free trade interests. Altogether, our analysis highlights the overlooked
importance of international trade for conflict over electoral
institutions.

**Gender Gaps and Hidden Majoritarianism in Proportional Representation
Systems**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
The share of women in politics is higher, on average, under closed-list
proportional representation (PR) electoral systems compared to
majoritarian systems. Yet even in PR systems, progress toward gender
parity has been slow and uneven across political hierarchies. We
consider the role of a common institutional feature of party
organization–seniority-based promotion–and argue that gender gaps in
career progression can emerge either due to direct bias in the seniority
system, or because majoritarian offices (such as local mayor and list
leader) serve as important steppingstones that create bottlenecks in
women’s career paths. Using more than a century of detailed
candidate-level data from Norway, we find that advancement is generally
gender-neutral across stages of a typical political career, but that
gender gaps emerge at majoritarian bottlenecks. However, we also
document how parties can employ workarounds to mitigate the adverse
effects of these bottlenecks on women’s progression into higher offices.
