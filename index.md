**Ethnic minorities and democratic support**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Ethnicity and democracy are generally expected to be at odds with each
other. However, studies rarely engage with the democratic preferences
and minorities and fail to consider democracy as a multifaceted concept,
combining majoritarian decision-making with counter-majoritarian rights
protection. This project argues that ethnic minorities view democracy in
light of their position within the polity. Their democratic preferences
are not unidimensional, but rather depend on the specific aspect of
democracy. The project investigates four core tenets of democracy:
electoral democracy, liberal democracy, social rights, and people rule;
as well as three oppositions to democracy: populism, illiberalism, and
authoritarianism. The project demonstrates that minorities differ in
their focus on distinct aspects of democracy. Minorities with a more
precarious association to the majority-dominated state – eastern
European historical minorities and western European Muslims – are
particularly concerned about liberal democracy and social rights, while
being more hesitant about electoral and popular democracy. Minorities
more rooted within the existing state – western European historical
minorities – show lower concern for democracy in general.

**Processing Economic Signals: Voter Responses to Growth, Unemployment,
Inflation and Stock Markets**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Economic voting theory suggests that voters reward incumbents for strong
economic performance and punish them for weak performance. However, this
view often ignores the multidimensional nature of the economy. Hence, we
lack systematic evidence about how voters simultaneously process
multiple economic signals. This study provides a comprehensive
examination of how voters respond to four key economic dimensions:
growth, unemployment, inflation, and stock markets. We develop a
theoretical framework distinguishing between different types of economic
reasoning: macroeconomic, egotropic, sociotropic, and distributive
reasoning. We first use descriptive data from OECD countries to
understand the economy’s dimensionality and analyze survey data from
national election studies to assess the impact on economic evaluations.
Finally, we present findings from survey experiments conducted in
Germany, Sweden, and the United States, tailored to analyze the impact
of the four economic dimensions in an ideal information setting. Our
results reveal interesting patterns in how voters process economic
information. Voters can discern relationships between economic
dimensions and their effects on personal and economic circumstances, and
distributional outcomes. Subsequently, all four signals independently
affect preferences for economic policy and voting intentions. Inflation
emerges as a dominant factor, shaping personal and national economic
evaluations. Our findings challenge traditional approaches to economic
voting by exploring how voters integrate multiple economic signals. By
emphasizing the multidimensionality of economic signals, we highlight
implications for democratic accountability.

**Violent Civilian Agency. The logic of civilian-to-civilian killings:
insights from the Korean War.**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The concept of violent civilian agency in wartime remains largely
unexplored. Challenging the prevailing view of civilians as passive
victims or bystanders of violence, we propose a theory of pre-emptive
civilian killings to explain the motive, timing, and location of
incidents where civilians proactively turn to violence against each
other during conflicts. Our argument suggests that civilian-on-civilian
violence primarily occurs in areas where locals have collaborated with
occupying military forces. Specifically, collaborators may engage in
preemptive killings of non-collaborators to prevent whistleblowing but
also prevent victims’ revenge, especially as invading forces retreat and
rival armed groups advance. We empirically test this theory using
geocoded event data from the Korean War (1950–1953), focusing on
civilian violence patterns surrounding the North Korean troops’ abrupt
retreat, ordered by Kim Il-sung. Our findings reveal a significant
increase in pre-emptive civilian killings following the retreat,
particularly in regions with high levels of prior collaboration. This
study makes three key contributions: it highlights the concept of
violent agency among civilians, theorizes the conditions under which
such agency emerges, and empirically tests these ideas using novel data.
By shedding light on civilian behaviour in war, our work reveals how
specific incentives and opportunities can lead civilians to become
active perpetrators of violence against one another.
