<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Online intergroup hostility is a pervasive and troubling issue, yet
experimental evidence on how to curb it remains scarce. This study
focuses on counterspeech as a means for users to reduce hate speech.
Informed by theories from social psychology about the role of empathy in
overcoming prejudice, we randomize four counterspeec strategies across
the senders of 2,102 xenophobic Twitter messages. Compared to the
control group, the three empathy-based strategies increase the sender’s
propensity to delete the xenophobic message, reduce the share of new
xenophobic messages over the following four weeks, and decrease other
users’ amplification of the xenophobic message. Among these strategies,
analogical perspective-taking, encouraging the sender to compare their
own experiences of being attacked online with their discriminatory
behavior towards the outgroup, is particularly effective. In contrast,
disapproval messages have weaker effects. These findings provide
theoretical and actionable insights for how to reduce intergroup
hostility and its online amplification.

**Downward Class Mobility and Far-Right Party Support (with Alan M.
Jacobs, UBC)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
The relative effects of economic and social change on support for
far-right parties persistently occupies the attention of scholars and
the public. We argue that many explanations, by examining short-run
economic change or levels of social and cultural characteristics, miss a
core determinant of the rise of the far right: long-run material
deterioration, with its concomitant implications for social status.
Employing intergenerational occupational mobility, a measure uniquely
able to capture both components, we provide the first broad evidence of
this pattern across 10 countries and 2 decades. We then distinguish (a)
between level and change effects with the aid of diagonal reference
models and (b) between income and status effects through the use of
historical occupational wage data. Downward (but not upward)
occupational mobility predicts far-right voting across ten developed
democracies and intergenerational differences in real income play a role
independent of occupational status.

**Executive Appointments under Legislative Oversight (with Mikael
Holmgren, Örebro University)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
A large literature argues that the executive’s appointment powers may
bestow them with a significant policy advantage against the legislature.
In practice, however, the legislature may also deploy a variety of
instruments to strike back at the executive. In this paper, we field
five decades’ worth of data from the Swedish government to investigate
whether the executive might adapt their appointment strategies to
legislative pressures. We take advantage of a vast system of ad-hoc
commissions that the Swedish ministers have developed over time to track
their sensitivity to the parliament’s partisan composition. We find
that, while the ministers generally oversample appointees from their own
parties, the overall distribution of political appointees also tends to
shift along with the parliament’s balance of power. In line with recent
theories of interbranch relations, our results highlight both the
executive’s penchant for strategic appointments and the legislature’s
constraining reach.

**Chasing Opportunities in the Knowledge Economy: Moving Places, Moving
Politics? (with Valentina Consiglio, University of Konstanz)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
The rise of the knowledge economy has profoundly transformed the
political landscape. Thriving urban knowledge hubs have become almost
synonymous with cosmopolitan environments whereas lagging-behind areas
are characterized by stronger anti-establishment sentiments. We advance
the literature with a more dynamic perspective by studying individual
relocations to examine the political consequences of the strong pull
into destinations that are typically more progressive than most places
of origin. We propose an innovative measure of local opportunity at the
NUTS-3 level in Germany and merge this “opportunity map” with
individual-level panel data to assess how relocations into knowledge
hubs affect political behavior. In line with a mechanism of
assimilation, we find strong and consistent evidence that moving to
opportunity fosters political integration and shifts political
preferences to the left. Our findings suggest that the ongoing movement
of populations from rural regions to prosperous cities may come with a
self-reinforcing political dynamic that creates a strong and lasting
progressive coalition in the mid- and long-term.

**The C-SPAN Effect: Televised Debates, Emotional Appeals, and Political
Accountability**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
We study the effect of televised broadcasts of floor debates on the
rhetoric and behavior of U.S. Congress Members. First, we show in a
differences-in-differences analysis that the introduction of C-SPAN
broadcasts in 1979 increased the use of emotional appeals in the House
relative to the Senate, where televised floor debates were not
introduced until later. Second, we use exogenous variation in C-SPAN
channel positioning as an instrument for C-SPAN viewership by
Congressional district and show that House Members from districts with
exogenously higher C-SPAN viewership are more emotive in floor debates.
Looking to electoral pressures as a mechanism, we find the emotionality
effect of C-SPAN is strongest in competitive districts. C-SPAN exposure
increases the vote share for incumbent Congress Members and citizens’
approval of their job in Congress, and more so among Members who speak
more emotionally. Contra accountability models of transparency, C-SPAN
has no effect on measures of legislative effort on behalf of
constituents, and if anything it reduces a politician’s constituency
orientation. We find that local news coverage – that is, mediated rather
than direct transparency – has the opposite effect of C-SPAN, increasing
legislative effort but with no effect on emotional rhetoric. These
results highlight the importance of audience and mediation in the
political impacts of higher transparency.

**The Limits of Decentralized Administrative Data Collection: Evidence
from Colombia (with Tara Slough, New York University)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
States collect vast amounts of data for use in policymaking and public
administration. To do so, central governments frequently solicit data
from decentralized bureaucrats. Because central governments use these
data in policymaking, decentralized bureaucrats may face incentives to
selectively report or misreport, limiting the quality of administrative
data. We study the production of a transparency index by measuring the
reporting behavior of bureaucrats in the near universe of Colombian
public sector entities. Using an original audit, we show that failure to
report and misreporting vary systematically in actual transparency
practices, revealing limits to the use of these data. Further, in
partnership with a Colombian government watchdog agency, we implement a
large-scale experiment that varies the salience of central government
oversight. Increased salience changed the data bureaucrats reported to
the central government. Similar dynamics across policy areas and regime
types are apt to limit the quality of state information in multiple
contexts.

**Evaluating the Effects of Inclusive Historical Narratives on
Democratic Attitudes: Evidence from India and the United States**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Concerns about the state of democracy have surged in several countries
amongst new evidence that many citizens do not value democratic
principles or accept election results. Many suggest that at the core of
these anti-democratic beliefs is a dismissal of some voters – ethnic
minorities – as lesser members of the nation. In this project, we study
whether historical narratives that highlight ethnic minorities’ positive
contributions to the nation increase perceptions that they are entitled
to speak on the nation’s behalf, and thereby enhance majority members
support for the democratic process. We theorize that inclusive
historical narratives can counteract the notion that minorities are
lesser members of the nation and thus, the anti-democratic belief that
their votes count less or not at all. To test our theory, we conduct
online experiments in the world’s two largest democracies: India and the
United States. In our experiments, we randomly assign participants
either politically neutral or inclusive educational content sourced from
real history textbooks. We then use both behavioral and stated
preference measures to evaluate whether differenthistorical narratives
affect perceptions of minorities’ place in the nation and support for
anti-democratic attitudes, norms, and policies. Our findings indicate
that battles over history education may carry consequences for majority
members’ support for democratic principles and ethnic minorities’
political voice.

**Information Processing in Participatory Governance**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Participatory governance institutions often aim to yield information
useful to policymakers, whether about public preferences, problems,
solutions, or perspectives. But how can large numbers of public
contributions be processed into interpretable and actionable information
outputs? As theorists and practitioners increasingly call for
participatory governance to operate at larger scales, often enabled by
new technologies, this challenge only becomes more important. Building
on research across political theory, public administration, and
political science, this paper develops and illustrates three claims:
First, that information processing plays an important and
under-appreciated role in participatory governance. Second, that there
are distinct types of information processing, best characterised by two
dimensions of specificity and novelty. And third, that these types
differ in their costs, in the extent to which they can be delegated to
non-experts or to automation, and in their potential consequences for
unrepresentative participation. Better recognising these differences
will help both researchers and practitioners better understand the
potential and the limitations of participatory governance institutions
in different settings and with different goals.

**Effects of economic and social incentives on bureaucratic quality:
Experimental Evidence from Sierra Leone (with Maarten Voors, Wageningen
University; Salif Jaiteh, IDinsight; Niccolo Meriggi, IGC ; Carlo Prato,
Columbia University; Peter van der Windt, New York University - Abu
Dhabi)**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Using a field experiment implemented in Sierra Leone we examine mixed
motives for local service providers. We find evidence consistent with
past literature that social pressure improves quality–albeit at a lower
levels than past studies have found. These gains however are no better
than gains from simple direct payment mechanisms that involve similar
direct costs but lower social costs. There is weak evidence of crowding
out effects. Analysis of a structural model identifies conditions
underwhich social or economic incentives are more or less likely to be
effective.
