**The peculiar politics of antitrust in Latin America: Institution
building and business backlash (2000-2020)**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Policy change and institution building in antitrust in Latin America
raise two main questions. First, how, in the space of only a decade
(2006-2016), did 3 of the richest and largest countries – Brazil, Chile,
and Mexico – build the strongest antitrust agencies and policies in the
region? The answers lie mostly in international dissemination of law and
best practices backed by foreign governments and firms. Second, how did
big business fight back to reduce the power of these agencies? The
answers here depend heavily on the varying political openings or
vulnerabilities that allowed individual businesses to contest agency
decisions or weaken agencies overall. These vulnerabilities arose mostly
in the judiciary in Mexico and through electoral laws and campaign
finance in Brazil. The political system in Chile had fewer such
vulnerabilities.

**Eligibility Uncertainty, Race, and Future Voting**

<details>

Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Does a lack of information among minority citizens about whether they
are eligible to register and vote in U.S. elections help explain the
large and increasing racial turnout gap? In a context like the U.S.
where registration and voting rules vary across states, a substantial
number of Americans are likely to be deterred from voting because they
think they are ineligible to register and vote. I argue that while the
direct, short-term effect of such eligibility uncertainty on turnout is
similar for White and minority Americans, long-term effects on future
voting will be different. Not voting due to eligibility uncertainty in
an earlier election will make minority Americans substantially less
likely to vote in future elections than Whites, most likely by
undermining their feelings of political efficacy. To test this theory, I
focus on uncertainty among young Americans about whether someone needs
to be 18 by the registration deadline or by Election Day to register and
vote in U.S. elections. Drawing on voter file data from a large number
of U.S. states and using a regression discontinuity design, I find
evidence in support of my theory. Young Black Americans who do not vote
in an earlier election due to eligibility uncertainty are substantially
less likely to vote in future elections than young White Americans.
Additional survey data provides suggestive evidence for political
efficacy as a possible mechanism. At a time of heightened concerns
around voter suppression, these findings highlight the need to pay more
attention to restrictive voting legislations’ long-term effects on
minority voter turnout.

**Ballots and Budgets: The Fiscal Consequences of Franchise Extensions**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Foundational political-economic theories predict that suffrage
expansions should increase the tax burden, especially on the rich.
However, this dynamic has proven difficult to find empirically. I argue
that de facto elite control helps explain this gap: when elites are
unified, they can block redistributive pressures even after
democratizing reforms. In contrast, when elites are fragmented, suffrage
expansion should affect taxes as expected. I test this insight by
leveraging the uneven extension of suffrage in historical Norwegian
municipalities, combining new data on local tax types and levels with
detailed land-holding inequality. Consistent with the theory, areas with
high inequality show negligible effects of suffrage on taxes, while more
egalitarian areas see higher revenues and greater reliance on modern
taxes, like income taxes. These findings contribute to a central debate
in political economy: under which circumstances democratization affects
taxation. But also to our understanding of how inter-elite dynamics can
shape democratic outcomes.
