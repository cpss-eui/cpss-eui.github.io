**The ethics of asking about violence: Early evidence from a multisite
experiment**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Political violence – including civil war, organized crime, and violent
extremism – is a major driver of human suffering around the world.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more
than 100 million people, or one in every 78 people on earth, were
displaced because of conflict or violence in 2022. Over the past two
decades, there has been a proliferation of research involving human
participants on the topic of violence in the social and behavioral
sciences. However, we have surprisingly little evidence about how
participating in research that asks about violence affects participants
and whether we are effectively adhering to principles around respect for
persons when doing research on this especially sensitive and high-stakes
topic. This talk will present preliminary evidence from a systematic
review and multisite experiment to measure the effects of participating
in research on violence and develop new methods to maximize adherence to
the ethical principles of respect for persons and beneficence.

**Mutual Knowledge of Social Norms and Political Activism**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Social norms are important drivers of human behavior. Problematically,
when individuals hold incorrect beliefs about others’ opinions, a norm
may be sustained even if a majority is against it (pluralistic
ignorance). However, it may not be sufficient to correct such
misperceptions as citizens may continue to believe that others do not
share the updated beliefs. In this case, creating mutual knowledge about
social norms may be necessary to induce behavioral change. We implement
a field experiment in Kyrgyzstan to test this hypothesis. We vary i)
whether women are provided with information on high social support for
female political engagement, and ii) whether women are informed that
this information is also provided to other women (“mutual knowledge”).
We find that providing information about high societal support has no
effect on women’s political engagement. However, women become less
engaged when we also experimentally create mutual knowledge about the
social norm opposing female engagement. Yet, there is no positive effect
on female engagement when providing mutual knowledge about high social
support. Using vignette experiments, we show that the asymmetry arises
because women fear community punishment—in case they are more active
than socially desired—more so than potential community praise when they
become active when more engagement is desired.
