Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Online intergroup hostility is a pervasive and troubling issue, yet
experimental evidence on how to curb it remains scarce. This study
focuses on counterspeech as a means for users to reduce hate speech.
Informed by theories from social psychology about the role of empathy in
overcoming prejudice, we randomize four counterspeec strategies across
the senders of 2,102 xenophobic Twitter messages. Compared to the
control group, the three empathy-based strategies increase the sender’s
propensity to delete the xenophobic message, reduce the share of new
xenophobic messages over the following four weeks, and decrease other
users’ amplification of the xenophobic message. Among these strategies,
analogical perspective-taking, encouraging the sender to compare their
own experiences of being attacked online with their discriminatory
behavior towards the outgroup, is particularly effective. In contrast,
disapproval messages have weaker effects. These findings provide
theoretical and actionable insights for how to reduce intergroup
hostility and its online amplification.

**Downward Class Mobility and Far-Right Party Support (with Alan M.
Jacobs, UBC)**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The relative effects of economic and social change on support for
far-right parties persistently occupies the attention of scholars and
the public. We argue that many explanations, by examining short-run
economic change or levels of social and cultural characteristics, miss a
core determinant of the rise of the far right: long-run material
deterioration, with its concomitant implications for social status.
Employing intergenerational occupational mobility, a measure uniquely
able to capture both components, we provide the first broad evidence of
this pattern across 10 countries and 2 decades. We then distinguish (a)
between level and change effects with the aid of diagonal reference
models and (b) between income and status effects through the use of
historical occupational wage data. Downward (but not upward)
occupational mobility predicts far-right voting across ten developed
democracies and intergenerational differences in real income play a role
independent of occupational status.

**Chasing Opportunities in the Knowledge Economy: Moving Places, Moving
Politics? (with Valentina Consiglio, University of Konstanz)**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The rise of the knowledge economy has profoundly transformed the
political landscape. Thriving urban knowledge hubs have become almost
synonymous with cosmopolitan environments whereas lagging-behind areas
are characterized by stronger anti-establishment sentiments. We advance
the literature with a more dynamic perspective by studying individual
relocations to examine the political consequences of the strong pull
into destinations that are typically more progressive than most places
of origin. We propose an innovative measure of local opportunity at the
NUTS-3 level in Germany and merge this “opportunity map” with
individual-level panel data to assess how relocations into knowledge
hubs affect political behavior. In line with a mechanism of
assimilation, we find strong and consistent evidence that moving to
opportunity fosters political integration and shifts political
preferences to the left. Our findings suggest that the ongoing movement
of populations from rural regions to prosperous cities may come with a
self-reinforcing political dynamic that creates a strong and lasting
progressive coalition in the mid- and long-term.

**Declared versus revealed support for democracy: Survey and real-world
evidence in Latin America (with Loreto Cox, Pontificia Universidad
Católica de Chile)**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Public support for democracy is believed to serve as a safeguard against
undemocratic behavior by politicians. Most of our measures of support
for democracy come from public opinion surveys, based on questions that
may suffer from social desirability bias and overlook the trade-offs
that citizens face when choosing candidates. In 2022, we conducted rich
two-wave panel surveys in Colombia and Peru. The baseline covered how
citizens understand and value democracy in the abstract, and included a
conjoint experiment, in which one of the manipulated attributes was
whether the candidate adopted anti-democratic positions, following
Graham and Svolik (2020). Shortly after, in December 2022, former Peru’s
president, Pedro Castillo, attempted a failed self-coup and was then
impeached by Congress. We compare (1) declared support for democracy in
baseline questions with (2) revealed democratic commitment when facing
trade-offs, as found in the conjoint, and (3) de facto support for
democracy leveraging Castillo’s (real-world) anti-democratic move. We
find that citizens behave slightly more democratically than a coin flip,
even those who are declared democrats. Moreover, declared democratic
attitudes weakly predict revealed democratic commitment. Citizens trade
in democracy for ideological proximity and see real-world democratic
deviations through partisan lenses. Our findings suggest a limited role
of citizens as a democratic check, especially in polarized democracies.
