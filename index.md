the presentation of work in progress by scholars from across the
subfield of comparative politics.

It usually takes place on Thursdays from 17:00 to 18:30 at Seminar Room
2, in Badia Fiesolana (Fiesole). See below or sync the
[calendar](webcal://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpss-eui/cpss-eui.github.io/main/events.ics)

**Speaking fast and low: The acoustics of authoritarian politics**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Do citizens embody their political institutions? We test this by
examining whether speech reflects freedom of speech with a comparative
political behavior approach. Using speech corpora intended for AI
speech-to-text recognition, we show that when exogenously assigned
sentences with political content in a discrete online environment,
Mandarin speakers from China—an authoritarian regime with low freedom of
speech—change the acoustics of their speech relative to Mandarin
speakers from Taiwan—a democracy with high freedom of speech—
controlling for both sentence and individual fixed effects. DiD
estimates suggest that Mainland Chinese speak ‘fast and low’, increase
their tempo and decrease their volume by and standard deviations (2
decibels/2 seconds) relative to Taiwanese speakers, robust to using
alternative variable or treatment definitions as well as alternative
sampling and modelling strategies. Neither Mandarin Bots nor English
speakers display a similar pattern. ‘Speaking fast and low’ about
politics is a prerogative of men. Further analysis suggests that the
gendered acoustics of authoritarian politics—which do not come up with
traditional survey analysis—are channeled by a ‘historical legacy’
mechanism more than by a ‘statistical discrimination’ one. Speakers with
accents from provinces that experienced stronger repression during the
1964 Cultural Revolution display significantly stronger stress, whereas
speakers from coastal provinces and special economic zones speak about
politics in a more normal manner. Authoritarianism is not only written
in laws, memories, and institutions—it is also spoken, in hurried and
hushed tones, every time politics comes up.

**It’s Not Me, it’s You: Redistributive Preferences and Fairness**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Fairness and deservingness are core principles for the formation of
public policy, and yet little consensus exists about how meritocracy
should influence redistributive policies such as a generous welfare
state or social protection. On the one hand, some policies designed to
ensure equal representation in education, employment, and government are
perceived as corrective measures for differences in opportunity or for
societal injustice. On the other, these same policies can be perceived
as unfair given they come into direct conflict with meritocracy.
Although classical economic theory suggests that preferences for
redistribution are simply a function of economic self-interest, a large
body of recent work including theoretical models, empirical evidence,
and experiments has shown that preferences are a complex mosaic
incorporating both selfish and other-regarding considerations. While an
influential literature has shown that individuals condition their policy
preferences on their views of fairness and deservingness (as a function
of how earnings are determined), none of the existing work accounts for
the reality that outcomes may be meritocratic for some but not others.
To close this gap, we present results from a lab experiment representing
the first causal investigation of redistributive preferences in the
presence of asymmetric earnings conditions. Although we find little
evidence that asymmetry as a general characteristic affects
redistributive preferences, we find strong evidence that fairness
considerations are asymmetric. Our results suggest that redistributive
preferences are only malleable for the rich and that their views of
deservingness are determined solely by the conditions of the poor.
Further, our findings suggest that fairness considerations are reference
dependent and counterfactual beliefs are an important moderator of the
relationship between fairness and redistributive preferences.

**A generative theory of party systems**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
I present a generative model of party systems. For a given system size
N, the model generates shares and positions of parties on an economic
left-right dimension. The model first generates shares with a mean
vector as described in Taagepera and Allik (2003) drawn from a Dirichlet
distribution as described in Cohen and Hanretty (2024). Positions are
then drawn according to four mechanisms: (1) positions weakly centred on
the position of the mean voter; (2) initial bimodality of the positions
of the largest party, (3) system autoregressive positions for the
second-largest to the last party, whereby positions of the nth party are
repelled by the share-weighted positions of all larger parties, and (4)
increasing dispersion with decreasing vote share. The model is trained
on data from over 300 elections. I discuss the implications of this
generative model for party system congruence and for polarization.

**The Shape of Democracy: Jurisdiction Boundaries and the Siting of
Renewable Energy Infrastructure**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Political science has long studied how the size and shape of
jurisdictions influence representation and governance, but much less is
known about their effects on policy outcomes. This paper addresses that
gap by examining how local jurisdictional structure shapes the siting of
wind turbines—a critical challenge for the green energy transition. We
develop a theoretical model which predicts how the division of voters
into local jurisdictions influence the siting of wind turbines (or:..
which predicts how the geographical distribution of voters within local
jurisdictions influence the siting of wind turbines). Using data on all
Danish wind turbines built between 2007 and 2021, and exploiting
Denmark’s 2007 municipal reform, which changed local boundaries while
leaving the landscape unchanged, we show that shifts in local
electorates strongly affect turbine siting. These results highlight how
the political geography of local governments shapes renewable energy
deployment, raising concerns about equity, efficiency, and democratic
legitimacy in decentralized climate policy.

**Against the Machine: Why Party Competition Disrupts Vote Buying**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
I will present elements of my forthcoming book, Against the Machine: Why
Party Competition Disrupts Vote Buying. The book offers a new
partisan-competition argument that accounts for variation in the success
and failure of vote-buying attempts better than existing institutional,
sociological, and organizational perspectives. After giving an overview
of the argument, I will focus on one of the three proposed
mechanisms: 1) partisan responses to electoral gifts that put opposition
voters out of the machines’ reach, 2) the influence of partisan
campaigns that reduce the machine’s ability to target the optimal
clients, or 3) partisan views of ballot secrecy that encourage
recipients to defect from the vote-buying bargain.
