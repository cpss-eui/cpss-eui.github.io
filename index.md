**The Populist Dynamic: Experimental Evidence on the Effects of
Countering Populism**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
We evaluate how traditional parties may respond to populist parties on
issues aligning with populist messages. During the 2020 Italian
referendum on the reduction of members of Parliament, we conducted a
large-scale field experiment, exposing 200 municipalities to nearly a
million impressions of programmatic advertisement. Our treatments
comprised two video ads against the reform: one debunking populist
rhetoric and another attributing blame to populist politicians. This
anti-populist campaign proved effective through demobilization, as it
reduced both turnout and the votes in favor of the reform. Notably, the
effects were more pronounced in municipalities with lower rates of
college graduates, higher unemployment, and a history of populist votes.
This exogenous influence introduced a unique populist dynamic,
observable in the 2022 national election where treated municipalities
showed increased support for Brothers of Italy, a rising populist party,
and decreased support for both traditional parties and the populists
behind the 2020 reform. A follow-up survey further showed increased
political interest and diminished trust in political institutions among
the residents of municipalities targeted by the campaign.

**Trust the hand that protects you – Do Military Interventions harm
Trust for the Government?**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>
Rebuilding state legitimacy is a thorny challenge in the aftermath of
civil wars. The international community has stepped in to support
states’ recovery, sometimes replacing governments in providing public
goods. Research shows that UN peacekeepers often become de facto
security providers. The article assesses whether and how external
provision of the most basic public good, i.e. security, affects
citizens’ trust towards the government. On the one hand, by providing a
secure environment, UN peacekeepers may facilitate the functioning of
domestic institutions, who could reap the reputational benefit of
working with the UN. However, I posit that attribution problems and
reputational costs counter the positive impact of UN’s capacity-building
efforts. The analysis focuses on the case of the UN mission in Mali
(MINUSMA) exploiting Afrobarometer’s geocoded surveys before and after
deployment, combined with subnational deployment data. The article
provides insights on how international interventions affect an
understudied aspect of state-building – i.e. the legitimacy of
institutions they are expected to assist.

**The Luck of the Draw: New Evidence on the Resource Curse From
Thousands of Randomized Income Shocks**

<details>
<summary>Abstract:</summary>
<p>

Much has been written on the “resource curse” in economics and political
science. Early work suggested a phenomenon by which countries rich in
natural resources and other organizations coming into windfalls often
had worse economic and political outcomes. More modern research has
sought to differentiate reasons for some countries and organizations
being more susceptible to adverse effects while others are able to
benefit. While often theoretically sophisticated, the important work on
this question suffers from serious problems of endogeneity as well as
the fact the population of potential cases is necessarily small.
Individual lottery winners have been used as a proxy. However, this
data-rich approach moves us too far from the original question.

To overcome these problems we analyze thousands of completely
randomized, large scale, income shocks to complex organizations. The
data come from every third round match in the English Football
Association Cup (FA Cup) since the format the tournament was changed in
1952. In this competition smaller, lower league teams are assigned by
lottery in the third round to play larger clubs and the clubs share the
ticket revenue, creating a potentially massive exogenous economic
windfall for small teams.

Our results suggest organizations benefit both in the short term and
long term from these income shocks and we can precisely estimate the
decay of the effect over time. We also provide evidence linking the
level of success to the organizational capacity of clubs and their
internal (political) decision making institutions. We discuss our
findings in relation to the larger resource curse literature and the
literature on organizational effectiveness.
