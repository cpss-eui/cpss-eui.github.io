<p><strong>Supportive Political Participation: The Effects of Serving as a Poll
Worker</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Participatory theories of democracy posit that participating in the
political process transforms individuals into better democratic
citizens. But empirical research on the individual-level effects of
participation focuses overwhelmingly on voting, with mixed results and
debate about the mechanisms. This study focuses on a different form of
political participation and leverages a natural experiment in Peru to
address the challenge posed by certain types of individuals
self-selecting into political participation. Prior to every election,
Peruvian officials randomly select citizens to serve as poll monitors on
Election Day. Following the January 2020 congressional elections, I
conducted a two-wave panel survey of these randomly selected poll
monitors and also randomly selected alternates. I find that
participation as a poll worker increases an individual’s senses of
empowerment and efficacy, but does not provoke political interest or
knowledge. I also find that participation boosts support for and trust
in democratic institutions, especially elections, and that it fosters
future civic participation. I find some evidence that these effects
endure, at least for several months, although my follow-up estimates are
less precise. Consistent with participatory theories of democracy,
participation of this kind does shape citizens.

<p><strong>Resemblance and Discrimination in Elections (with Stavros Poupakis,
Brunel University London)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Discrimination affects hiring, mating and voting decisions. Whilst
discrimination in elections mainly relates to gender or race, we
introduce a novel source of discrimination: candidate resemblance. When
candidates’ partisanship is not known, voters select those that resemble
most elected co-partisans. Using a machine learning algorithm for face
comparison among white male legislators, we find a stronger resemblance
effect for Republicans compared to Democrats in the US. This happens
because Republicans have a higher within-party facial resemblance than
Democrats, even when accounting for gender and race. We find a similar
pattern in the UK, where Conservative MPs are more similar looking to
each other than Labour. Using a survey experiment, we find that Tory
voters reward resemblance, while there is no similar effect for Labour.
The results are consistent with an interpretation of this behaviour as a
form of statistical discrimination.

<p><strong>In or Out? Xenophobic Violence and Immigrant Integration. Evidence
from 19th century France (with Stephane Wolton, LSE)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
How do immigrants respond to xenophobic violence? We study how Italian
immigrants responded to a wave of anti-Italian violence triggered by the
assassination of the French president by an Italian anarchist in June
1894. Using French nominative census records from 1886, 1891 and 1896
and official naturalization decrees published between 1887 to 1898, we
study the decision of Italian immigrants to either leave their host
communities or apply for naturalization using a
difference-in-differences design, comparing the change in exit and
naturalization application rate of Italians before and after the
assassination to that of other foreigners in the same period. We
document how xenophobic violence triggered an increase in both exits and
naturalization applications, with greater violence or threat thereof
associated with more exits and naturalization applications. We also find
that well-integrated Italians, as proxied by family status, are more
likely to naturalize and less integrated ones are more likely to exit.
We present a stylized model of immigrants’ choices to make sense of
these findings

<p><strong>Cultural Roots of Negative Outgroup Attitudes: Theory and Evidence
from the Re-activation of Antisemitic Stereotypes in Germany (with Eylem
Kanol, WZB)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Outgroup prejudice is frequently attributed to contemporaneous factors,
such as economic competition and perceptions of threat. We investigate
the underlying source of stereotypes. We propose that many negative
outgroup attitudes are ultimately rooted in what we refer to as cultural
scripts—interconnected networks of meanings that link particular group
identities to negatively-connoted phenomena. Using original survey data
during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany (n=17,800), we document a rise
in antisemitic attitudes among individuals directly exposed to the
pandemic, but solely among Christian believers. We suggest that this is
because Christians rely on a cultural script linking Judaism with the
spread of diseases. Evidence for the existence of this script is
obtained from an automated text analysis of an original corpus of
antisemitic texts (n=172). By means of a concept association task and a
survey experiment (n=2,000), we demonstrate the differential effect of
the script in the minds of Christians and non-Christians. We rule out
several alternative explanations, particularly right-wing ideology. Our
work demonstrates the deep cultural roots of exclusionary political
attitudes and the mechanisms behind their activation.

<p><strong>“Evaluating the Effects of Inclusive Historical Narratives on
Democratic Attitudes: Evidence from India and the United States” (with
Nicholas Haas, Aarhus University)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Concerns about the state of democracy have surged in several countries
amongst new evidence that many citizens do not value democratic
principles or accept election results. Many suggest that at the core of
these anti-democratic beliefs is a dismissal of some voters – ethnic
minorities – as lesser members of the nation. In this project, we study
whether historical narratives that highlight ethnic minorities’ positive
contributions to the nation increase perceptions that they are entitled
to speak on the nation’s behalf, and thereby enhance majority members
support for the democratic process. We theorise that inclusive
historical narratives can counteract the notion that minorities are
lesser members of the nation and thus, the anti-democratic belief that
their votes count less or not at all. To test our theory, we conduct
online experiments in the world’s two largest democracies: India and the
United States. In our experiments, we randomly assign participants
either politically neutral or inclusive educational content sourced from
real history textbooks. We then use both behavioural and stated
preference measures to evaluate whether different historical narratives
affect perceptions of minorities’ place in the nation and support for
anti-democratic attitudes, norms, and policies. Our findings indicate
that battles over history education may carry consequences for majority
members’ support for democratic principles and ethnic minorities’
political voice.

<p><strong>Is Political Ignorance bliss? The Social and Political Effects of
Facebook (with Martial Foucault, CEVIPOF; Kalli Giannelos, CEVIPOF &amp;
Paris-Dauphine; Jonathan Ladd, Georgetown U; Can Zengin, CEVIPOF &amp;

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Nearly three billion people actively use Facebook, making it the largest
social media platform in the world. Previous research shows that the
social media platform reduces users’ happiness, while increasing
political knowledge. It also may increase partisan polarization. Working
to build a scientific consensus, we test whether the potential negative
effects of Facebook use can be overcome with the help of minimalist
informational interventions that a parallel line of research has shown
to be effective at inducing people to be more accurate and civil. We
conducted a preregistered well-powered Facebook deactivation experiment
during the 2022 French presidential election. In line with previous
research, we find that Facebook reduces happiness, informs, and
increases partisan polarization but only among college educated
individuals. In contrast, we find little evidence that minimalist
informational interventions in a field setting helped individuals who
deactivated Facebook to seek out news, be more accurate or less
polarized.

<p><strong>Trade Origins of Proportional Representation (with Irene Menéndez
Gonzalez, IE University)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
While recent research on the origins of Proportional Representation (PR)
in Europe has focused on domestic political explanations, we bring
international trade back to the analysis of electoral system choice.
First, we sharpen earlier arguments and specify the partisan trade
theory of endogenous electoral institutions, which highlights how the
misrepresentation of trade interests in parliament shapes support for
PR. Second, we test the theory using district-level referendum data and
a natural experiment during the first globalization in Switzerland. We
find a robust positive relationship between the vote for free trade and
the subsequent vote for PR. Moreover, within-district change in the
protectionist factor was tightly linked to changes in the PR vote.
Leveraging plausibly exogenous variation in the introduction of PR
across cantons, we also find that PR reduced the underrepresentation of
free trade interests. Altogether, our analysis highlights the overlooked
importance of international trade for conflict over electoral
institutions.

<p><strong>Gender Gaps and Hidden Majoritarianism in Proportional Representation
Systems</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The share of women in politics is higher, on average, under closed-list
proportional representation (PR) electoral systems compared to
majoritarian systems. Yet even in PR systems, progress toward gender
parity has been slow and uneven across political hierarchies. We
consider the role of a common institutional feature of party
organization–seniority-based promotion–and argue that gender gaps in
career progression can emerge either due to direct bias in the seniority
system, or because majoritarian offices (such as local mayor and list
leader) serve as important steppingstones that create bottlenecks in
women’s career paths. Using more than a century of detailed
candidate-level data from Norway, we find that advancement is generally
gender-neutral across stages of a typical political career, but that
gender gaps emerge at majoritarian bottlenecks. However, we also
document how parties can employ workarounds to mitigate the adverse
effects of these bottlenecks on women’s progression into higher offices.

<p><strong>Defending Parliament: Responses of mainstream parties to parliamentary
erosion</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
How does the presence of extremist parties in parliaments modify
parliamentary norms? In this talk, I draw on two recent papers to
examine the responses of mainstream politicians to the disruptive
strategies of extremist legislators. A first study examines the dynamics
of parliamentary erosion during the Weimar parliament. Using a novel
dataset of all calls-to-order, I document the existence of a cycle of
provocation-counter provocation that led to the erosion of parliamentary
norms in the last years of the Weimar Republic. A second paper
(co-authored with Qixuan Yang) studies informal interactions in the
contemporary German Bundestag during the period between 2017 and 2021.
Using a novel dataset of over 25,000 parliamentary speeches, we document
a significant erosion of parliamentary norms, as measured by an increase
in the number of verbal and nonverbal interruptions. Both legislators
from mainstream and extremist parties contribute to this erosion of
parliamentary norms.

Abstract:

<p>
Online intergroup hostility is a pervasive and troubling issue, yet
experimental evidence on how to curb it remains scarce. This study
focuses on counterspeech as a means for users to reduce hate speech.
Informed by theories from social psychology about the role of empathy in
overcoming prejudice, we randomize four counterspeec strategies across
the senders of 2,102 xenophobic Twitter messages. Compared to the
control group, the three empathy-based strategies increase the sender’s
propensity to delete the xenophobic message, reduce the share of new
xenophobic messages over the following four weeks, and decrease other
users’ amplification of the xenophobic message. Among these strategies,
analogical perspective-taking, encouraging the sender to compare their
own experiences of being attacked online with their discriminatory
behavior towards the outgroup, is particularly effective. In contrast,
disapproval messages have weaker effects. These findings provide
theoretical and actionable insights for how to reduce intergroup
hostility and its online amplification.

<p><strong>Downward Class Mobility and Far-Right Party Support (with Alan M.
Jacobs, UBC)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The relative effects of economic and social change on support for
far-right parties persistently occupies the attention of scholars and
the public. We argue that many explanations, by examining short-run
economic change or levels of social and cultural characteristics, miss a
core determinant of the rise of the far right: long-run material
deterioration, with its concomitant implications for social status.
Employing intergenerational occupational mobility, a measure uniquely
able to capture both components, we provide the first broad evidence of
this pattern across 10 countries and 2 decades. We then distinguish (a)
between level and change effects with the aid of diagonal reference
models and (b) between income and status effects through the use of
historical occupational wage data. Downward (but not upward)
occupational mobility predicts far-right voting across ten developed
democracies and intergenerational differences in real income play a role
independent of occupational status.

<p><strong>Executive Appointments under Legislative Oversight (with Mikael
Holmgren, Örebro University)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
A large literature argues that the executive’s appointment powers may
bestow them with a significant policy advantage against the legislature.
In practice, however, the legislature may also deploy a variety of
instruments to strike back at the executive. In this paper, we field
five decades’ worth of data from the Swedish government to investigate
whether the executive might adapt their appointment strategies to
legislative pressures. We take advantage of a vast system of ad-hoc
commissions that the Swedish ministers have developed over time to track
their sensitivity to the parliament’s partisan composition. We find
that, while the ministers generally oversample appointees from their own
parties, the overall distribution of political appointees also tends to
shift along with the parliament’s balance of power. In line with recent
theories of interbranch relations, our results highlight both the
executive’s penchant for strategic appointments and the legislature’s
constraining reach.

<p><strong>Chasing Opportunities in the Knowledge Economy: Moving Places, Moving
Politics? (with Valentina Consiglio, University of Konstanz)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The rise of the knowledge economy has profoundly transformed the
political landscape. Thriving urban knowledge hubs have become almost
synonymous with cosmopolitan environments whereas lagging-behind areas
are characterized by stronger anti-establishment sentiments. We advance
the literature with a more dynamic perspective by studying individual
relocations to examine the political consequences of the strong pull
into destinations that are typically more progressive than most places
of origin. We propose an innovative measure of local opportunity at the
NUTS-3 level in Germany and merge this “opportunity map” with
individual-level panel data to assess how relocations into knowledge
hubs affect political behavior. In line with a mechanism of
assimilation, we find strong and consistent evidence that moving to
opportunity fosters political integration and shifts political
preferences to the left. Our findings suggest that the ongoing movement
of populations from rural regions to prosperous cities may come with a
self-reinforcing political dynamic that creates a strong and lasting
progressive coalition in the mid- and long-term.

<p><strong>The C-SPAN Effect: Televised Debates, Emotional Appeals, and Political
Accountability</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
We study the effect of televised broadcasts of floor debates on the
rhetoric and behavior of U.S. Congress Members. First, we show in a
differences-in-differences analysis that the introduction of C-SPAN
broadcasts in 1979 increased the use of emotional appeals in the House
relative to the Senate, where televised floor debates were not
introduced until later. Second, we use exogenous variation in C-SPAN
channel positioning as an instrument for C-SPAN viewership by
Congressional district and show that House Members from districts with
exogenously higher C-SPAN viewership are more emotive in floor debates.
Looking to electoral pressures as a mechanism, we find the emotionality
effect of C-SPAN is strongest in competitive districts. C-SPAN exposure
increases the vote share for incumbent Congress Members and citizens’
approval of their job in Congress, and more so among Members who speak
more emotionally. Contra accountability models of transparency, C-SPAN
has no effect on measures of legislative effort on behalf of
constituents, and if anything it reduces a politician’s constituency
orientation. We find that local news coverage – that is, mediated rather
than direct transparency – has the opposite effect of C-SPAN, increasing
legislative effort but with no effect on emotional rhetoric. These
results highlight the importance of audience and mediation in the
political impacts of higher transparency.

<p><strong>The Limits of Decentralized Administrative Data Collection: Evidence
from Colombia (with Tara Slough, New York University)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
States collect vast amounts of data for use in policymaking and public
administration. To do so, central governments frequently solicit data
from decentralized bureaucrats. Because central governments use these
data in policymaking, decentralized bureaucrats may face incentives to
selectively report or misreport, limiting the quality of administrative
data. We study the production of a transparency index by measuring the
reporting behavior of bureaucrats in the near universe of Colombian
public sector entities. Using an original audit, we show that failure to
report and misreporting vary systematically in actual transparency
practices, revealing limits to the use of these data. Further, in
partnership with a Colombian government watchdog agency, we implement a
large-scale experiment that varies the salience of central government
oversight. Increased salience changed the data bureaucrats reported to
the central government. Similar dynamics across policy areas and regime
types are apt to limit the quality of state information in multiple
contexts.

<p><strong>Information Processing in Participatory Governance</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
Participatory governance institutions often aim to yield information
useful to policymakers, whether about public preferences, problems,
solutions, or perspectives. But how can large numbers of public
contributions be processed into interpretable and actionable information
outputs? As theorists and practitioners increasingly call for
participatory governance to operate at larger scales, often enabled by
new technologies, this challenge only becomes more important. Building
on research across political theory, public administration, and
political science, this paper develops and illustrates three claims:
First, that information processing plays an important and
under-appreciated role in participatory governance. Second, that there
are distinct types of information processing, best characterised by two
dimensions of specificity and novelty. And third, that these types
differ in their costs, in the extent to which they can be delegated to
non-experts or to automation, and in their potential consequences for
unrepresentative participation. Better recognising these differences
will help both researchers and practitioners better understand the
potential and the limitations of participatory governance institutions
in different settings and with different goals.

Using a field experiment implemented in Sierra Leone we examine mixed

levels than past studies have found. These gains however are no better
than gains from simple direct payment mechanisms that involve similar
direct costs but lower social costs. There is weak evidence of crowding
out effects. Analysis of a structural model identifies conditions
underwhich social or economic incentives are more or less likely to be
effective.

<p><strong>State-evading Solutions to Violence: Organized Crime and Governance in
Indigenous Mexico (with Kristof Gosztonyi, Universität Osnabrück; and
Sarah Thompson, Stanford University)</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>
Abstract:
</summary>
<p>
The monopoly of violence in the hands of the state is associated with
the creation of political order. This influential vision about the
emergence of order misses the important problem that parts of the state
and its law enforcement apparatus often become extensions of criminality
rather than solutions to it. We argue that one solution to this dilemma
is to “opt out from the state.” Using a multi-method strategy combining
qualitative research, quasi-experimental statistical analysis, and
survey data, the paper demonstrates that indigenous communities in
Mexico are better able to escape predatory criminal rule and to live
more secure where they are legally allowed to carve a space of autonomy
from the state through the institution of “usos y costumbres.” We trace
this outcome to the presence of strong direct participatory democratic
practices, the presence of a community police run by local townsmen, and
a parallel system of justice independent from the state, making
communities more immune to cartel infiltration.
